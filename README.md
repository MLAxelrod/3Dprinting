3D print designs

[TubeRack_UnderMagnet](TubeRack_UnderMagnet.stl) is a design for a 3D printed rack for 15mL Falcon tubes that fit very nicely under the quad magnets commonly used for magnetic column sepration. We did an 8 x 3 spaced design so you can fit tubes for waste, positive fraction and negative fraction lined up.
